# Ravenous project

In the Ravenous project, I’ll build a restaurant recommendation website that allows users to search for local businesses based on their location and keywords. Using a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and the Yelp API, I will create an application that replicates the core functionality of Yelp. 

## Part 1: Creating Project & Components

In this first part of a four-part project, I lay the foundations of Ravenous by building the website’s homepage. By the end, I have created a static interface for Ravenous, which features a header, a search bar, and a list of businesses.

Through the four parts of Ravenous, I’ll build upon this foundation, adding features such as sorting and filtering options, and dynamic search results. By the end of the project, I’ll have developed a fully functional restaurant recommendation website that will help users find their next favorite eatery.
